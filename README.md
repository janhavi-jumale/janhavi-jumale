## 🧠 About

Self-learning my way through the cybersecurity world — one lab, one exploit, one script at a time.

Currently building real skills in:

- 🧩 **DSA in Python**
- 🛡️ **Blue Team**: SOC Tools, Threat Detection, SIEM
- ⚔️ **Red Team**: Web Hacking, Kali Linux, Burp Suite
- 🐧 **Linux • Bash • Scripting**
- 📖 **TryHackMe, Real-world labs, and more**

I'm here to document it all, stay consistent, and show proof of work.

## 🌍 My Journey = Learning in Public

No shortcuts.  
No fake flex.  
Just daily progress, curiosity, and proof of work.

> *"One step a day toward becoming a badass cyber engineer."*
